Each starting hand was ran 10 000 against random other cards that are possible in a standar 52-card deck. 

the number at the end of the test name indicates how many other players took part of the game (that is, players that got random cards).

As represents the ace of spades, 10c represents the 10 of clubs, Kd king of diamonds, and 2h the 2 of hearts. 

The last number with the % represents the percentage of wins (wins include ties) 
If the number doesn't have the % nor the suit suffix, then that's also a percentage of wins.

I didn't run all the possible hands because that would take forever on my machine.
