The way Texas Hold'em Poker works players combine the two cards in
their hands with the cards at the center of the table and they
assemble the best set of five cards possible.

The rarer the set of five cards, the higher its ranking. Royal
flushes (check the rankings by pressing r and then enter) are
extremely rare and as such are the highest value hands. Pairs, on
the other hand, are way more common, so when player 1 has a royal
flush and player 2 has a pair, player 1 should be declared the
winner.

You can press r at any prompt to see the rankings, but you also
need to know about tiebreakers for hands of the same ranking:

Royal flushes always tie, which means both players split the pot.

The better between two straight flushes is the one with the highest
value card.

Four of a kind of a higher value win and in case of a tie (not
possible with the standard deck you're using) the extra card is the
deciding factor. If everything's equal, then players split the pot.
This is true for the rest of the hands.
