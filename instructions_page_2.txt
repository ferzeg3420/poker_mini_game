Hopefully you start to see a pattern, higher cards in the repeated
set decide the winner and then the rest of the higher cards are
succesively used as tie breakers going from highest to lowest.

But let's continue for completeness's sake: Full houses are decided
by the higher three repeated cards, then the pair.

Flushes are decided by the higher cards in the flush.

Normal straights are decided just like straight flushes.

Three of a kind are decided by the three repeated cards, then the
rest of the cards from highest to lowest of course.

Two pairs are decided by the higher pair, then the lower, and finally
by the remaining card.

A pair is decided first by the card value of the pairs and then by
all the remaining cards.

If all else fails, then high cards determine the winner.
